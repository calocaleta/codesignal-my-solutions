| 6 | [Make Array Consecutive 2](./Intro-06-makeArrayConsecutive2) | Ratiorg got `statues` of different sizes as a present from CodeMaster for his birthday, each statue having an non-negative integer size. Since he likes to make things perfect, he wants to arrange them from smallest to largest so that each statue will be bigger than the previous one exactly by `1`. He may need some additional statues to be able to accomplish that. Help him figure out the minimum number of additional statues needed.. | [makeArrayConsecutive2.rb](./Intro-06-makeArrayConsecutive2/makeArrayConsecutive2.rb) | 6 | :heavy_check_mark: |

| 11 | [Is Lucky](./Intro-11-isLucky) | Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered *lucky* if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. | [isLucky.rb](./Intro-11-isLucky/isLucky.rb) | 7 | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 12 | [Sort by Height](./Intro-12-sortByHeight) | Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees. People can be very tall! | [sortByHeight.rb](./Intro-12-sortByHeight/sortByHeight.rb) | 10 | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 13 | [Reverse In Parentheses](./Intro-13-reverseInParentheses) | Write a function that reverses characters in (possibly nested) parentheses in the input string. | [reverseInParentheses.rb](./Intro-13-reverseInParentheses/reverseInParentheses.rb) | 18 | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 14 | [Alternating Sums](./Intro-14-alternatingSums) | Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into ***team 1***, the second goes into ***team 2***, the third goes into ***team 1*** again, the fourth into ***team 2***, and so on. | [alternatingSums.rb](./Intro-14-alternatingSums/alternatingSums.rb) | 8 | :heavy_check_mark: |
