# Palindrome

A string that doesn't changed when reversed (it reads the same backward and forward).

### Examples:

- `"eye"` is a palindrome
- `"noon"` is a palindrome
- `"decaf faced"` is a palindrome
- `"taco cat"` is **not** a palindrome (backwards it spells `"tac ocat"`)
- `"racecars"` is **not** a palindrome (backwards it spells `"sracecar"`)
